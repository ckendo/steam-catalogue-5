				<p>In September, MIT China Care approached us about a potential collaboration to organize a fundraising and community art project together to help orphanages in China. In the nature of supporting more unexpected and interesting collaborations, we decided to take the offer. While most often viewed in the context of education, STEAM has broader applications and implications in the way we work with others and approach new experiences and problems. For me, STEAM is as much about integrating the disparate fields of art and technology as breaking down barriers of collaboration. This particular collaboration between two very different clubs resulted in the “Give Love” campaign.</p>

				</div> -->
				<p>“Give Love” was a community art and fundraising project to help orphanages in China, using art as a medium to raise awareness towards an important issue that is, many times, treated with apathy. The mission of the China Care Foundation is to give special needs Chinese orphans the opportunity for a better life and to empower youth through direct humanitarian service. By providing extensive medical, social, and educational programs devoted to children, China Care makes a lasting contribution to our shared future. China Care has given opportunities to many bright, young students. The MIT students who have been touched by the work of China Care feel compelled to give back, but what about others? How to do you get those not directly affected by the problem to care? As we planned the project, this is the question we set out to answer.</p>
				<div id="mit-collapse" class="collapse">
					<p>The brainstorming for the community art project and fundraiser was a month-long process between members of STEAM, China Care, and Arts at MIT. During the discussions, we decided that we wanted a project that would encourage teamwork between the clubs, participation from the MIT community and general Boston community, and learning new skills while making of the art piece. The final idea we came up with is depicted below:</p>

The central piece is between two informational boards, and the entire piece is bordered with laser cut acrylic hearts. Participants were able to purchase stuffed animals, write a note for an orphan, and add their stuffed animal into one of the cubbies. Participant were then invited to attend the banquet and reveal of the finished piece in October. There were some slight modifications to the piece during the build process, and the finished piece is shown to the right:</p>

					<p>Through the making of this project, STEAM members were given the opportunity to learn new fabrication skills such as using the CNC router, band saw, chop saw, sander, and laser cutter. The art installation was exhibited in the Wiesner Gallery during the months of November 2015 through January 2016. All proceeds and stuffed animals were donated to the OneSky foundation.

					<p><span class="bold">HUBweek Boston</span></p>
					<p>This year, Boston and Cambridge held the inaugural HUBweek Boston, a week-long festival showcasing some of the world-class work happening at the intersection of art, science, and technology. HUBweek is an unique collaboration between The Boston Globe, Harvard, MIT, and the Massachusetts General Hospital. Unfortunately, many of the events were scheduled during class times, but MIT STEAM, along with Yale STEAM president, Chanthia Ma, got to check out some of the events during the weekend.</p>
					<p>The first event of the day was “The Future of Learning Lab,” co-hosted by educators and researchers from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, MIT Media Lab’s Lifelong Kindergarten Group, Cambridge Public Schools, and the Harvard Ed Portal. The event was set up to explore new possibilities for learning through hands-on workshops, interactive activities, and participatory demonstrations.</p>
					<div class="img-center visible-xs visible-sm">
						<img src="img/mit/little-bits.jpg"/>
						<p class="caption-center">Chanthia Ma (Yale) and Grace Li (MIT) at Boston HUBweek.</p>
					</div>	
					<p>I was able to play around with littleBits modules for the first time. Chanthia and I also participated in a collaborative pulley design competition with people of all ages.</p>
					<p>As MIT STEAM plans to move forward with more events geared towards STEAM in education, the event showcased the creativity and fun possibilities of including the arts in topics such as electronics and mechanical design.</p>
					<p>Afterwards, we took the Orange Line to Boston Cyberarts Inc., where we checked out the Curious Sound Objects series, an exhibition with sound and sculptural works at the intersection of art and science. Walking in, the exhibit was underwhelming at first. A pair of red gloves and a painting hung on one wall. There was a chair with headphones placed against another wall. A rectangular mesh of black cables stood in the center of the room, and a strange glass blown object with projections hung from the ceiling. As I started to read the descriptions of the pieces though, I was happily surprised by many of them.</p>
					<p>The art piece with the red gloves was called <span class="italic">Skull Whispering</span>, made by Don Blair and Sands Fish. I touched the pointer finger of one of the red gloves to my forehead while Chanthia whispered into the pointer finger of the other glove from across the room. I was able to hear Chanthia’s voice perfectly, with her words reverberating through my skull. The installation was meant to show how the walls between our minds could be erased, making use of wireless technology and mobile devices. Another piece I really enjoyed was Ranjit Bhatnagar’s <span class="italic">Sonnets From the Portuguese</span>. It is terribly unassuming at first glance—a painting connected to a jar, which is placed on a shelf. When you move the jar next to different locations on the painting, however, you start hearing sonnets.</p>

				<p>Yale STEAM saw our biggest events this year through collaborations with Yale’s Center for Engineering Innovation and Design (CEID), the Digital Humanities Lab, and the Peabody Museum of Natural History. Celebrating our second year on campus, Yale STEAM is reaching a broader audience in exploring the intersection of the arts, sciences, and humanities. </p>
				<br>
				<p class="bold">Musical Acoustics and Instrumental Design, Fall 2015</p>
				<p>Stemming from our connection built since the inception of Yale STEAM, it was about time for a STEAM event at the CEID. As a space for innovation in engineering and design, we hoped to use the center’s design space to host an event that could translate from the classroom into the workspace. Dr. Larry Wilen, one of the instructors of the ever popular Musical Acoustics and Instrumental Design course agreed to help host an integrative event under the same name for students who either could not take the course or were simply interested in the topics covered.  Starting in the classroom space at the CEID, Dr. Wilen, along with co-instructors Dr. Konrad Kaczmarek and Thibault Bertrand, began the workshop with an introduction to 3D modeling. Next, we moved to the computer lab to learn the fundamentals of SolidWorks and 3D rendered our own simple musical instrument that looked oddly similar to a comb! Dr. Wilen taught us how to model the resonant frequencies of each of the prongs of the (comb) instrument. Although this feature of SolidWorks was meant to map the resonant frequencies for the design of bridges and buildings to minimize collapse due to varying wind frequencies, we used the function to create a scale on our instrument.</p>
				<div id="yale-collapse" class="collapse">
					<p>We then cut out from wood our musical designs using the CEID’s lasercutter - one of the facility’s most popular equipment besides the 3D printers. It was a good reminder to cut from wood – recalling that 3D modeling and design does not necessarily mean 3D printing. After collecting our comb-like musical devices, we saw the slight imperfections of the reality of computer-modeled designs. In attempting to play the scale on the instruments by plucking the prongs, we heard that the scale was grossly out of tune. The workshop now moved to the workbenches where students sanded the prongs at the tip for a higher pitch or create a dent at the base for a lower pitch. Everyone was very excited to fine-tune the instruments, which turned out to be a very time-intensive process! At the end of the workshop, each participant took home their musical instrument to show off to their friends the beautiful, albeit still slightly out of tune, instruments.</p>

					<p class="bold">Beyond Boundaries Symposium, Spring 2016</p>
					<p>The newly established Digital Humanities Lab at Sterling Memorial Library shares many of the same fundamental goals and visions as Yale STEAM. The founding of the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLab) in the fall of 2015 signifies Yale University’s continued commitment to cutting-edge research and teaching in the humanities. Offering space, community, and resources for Yale faculty and students working with digital methods to address humanistic inquiries, the DHLab functions as a hub on the Yale campus for sustained digital humanities conversations and research at the intersection of the arts and sciences.</p>

					</div> -->
					<p>During most of the fall, we met with the director Peter Leonard and Catherine DeRose, the Outreach Manager, to discuss ideas for an collaborative event. We arrived at the idea of curating a symposium for faculty and students to present their research in digital humanities and STEAM oriented fields. Thus, the idea for the first annual STEAM symposium at Yale was born – a tradition we hope to continue through the upcoming years. This year, the Beyond Boundaries symposium hosted projects from English Literature to Near Eastern Civilizations, from the Department of Painting and Printmaking at the art school to the Technology and Innovation Lab at the Child Study Center at the medical school.</p>
					<p>As the moderator for the roundtable discussions at the Beyond Boundaries symposium, along with Gideon Fink Shapiro, a postdoctoral associate researcher at the DHLab, I introduced professors whose research in art conservation methodology, medieval musical manuscripts, and computer graphics incorporate the rigor of the scientific method with a background in and a purpose of the arts and humanities. The faculty from various fields of study presented at the roundtable discussions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Rebekah Ahrendt, Department of Music: “On Letters, ‘Discovery,’ and Collaboration”</li>
						<li>Anikó Bezur, Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage (IPCH), Technical Studies Lab Ian McClure, Yale University Art Gallery and IPCH Conservation Lab: “Making the Invisible Visible: How Science Advances Research in Art History and Beyond”</li>
						<li>Amy Hungerford, Director, Division of the Humanities; English, American Studies: “Reading, Machines, and the Humanities”</li>
						<li>Holly Rushmeier, Computer Science: “Computer Graphic”</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Students of all levels were also welcome to submit applications for either an oral presentation or poster session. The oral presentations ranged from “XML and TEI P5 as Pedagogic Tools: The Case of Medieval Manuscript Rolls” to “Tones in Vogue: An Analysis of Skin Color in Vogue Fashion Photography.” One undergraduate presenter demonstrated how an understanding of the language processing networks of the brain can create an computer algorithm that can redefine the essence of human generated poetry in his talk titled ““Glitch Lyric: Neural Networks and Poetry.” Another researcher from the medical school explained how the “Design-Thinking Approach” combines design and engineering in working with pediatric patients with disabilities at the Child Study Center at the medical school.</p>
					<p>Poster presentations varied from the traditional poster board to interactive digital displays on Mac screens to a projection of an art piece on fiberboard that vocalized when hit with light in the right places. Projects ranged from “AERID: The Ancient Egyptian Rock Inscription Database Project” by a Postdoctoral Associate in the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department, to “outofthedesert.yale.edu: A Digital Exhibit on Japanese American Internment” by an exchange scholar from Stanford University, to “Cold Body, Hot Brains: Patterns of Desire in Line and Language” from an MFA Candidate at the Department of Painting and Printmaking, to “Expanding the Museum Experience with Conversational User Interfaces” by an undergraduate student pursuing Electrical Engineering & Computer Science.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Peabody Casting and Molding Workshop, Spring 2016</p>
					<p>After planning since the summer for a workshop with the Peabody Museum of Natural History, the oldest facility on Yale’s science hill, we finally finalized the details for two consecutive sessions with David Heiser, the Director of Student Programs at the Peabody. Headed by resident museum preparatory Michael Anderson and senior instructor Armand Morgan, we started the first session of the two-part workshop series with a tour of the Peabody museum, a wonder many Yalies have never stepped foot into due to its far location from main campus. We focused our time examining and learning the history behind the dioramas – the background painting behind each exhibit in the museum. Each diorama was painted on a rounded wall for a wide-angle perspective that starkly resembles the world outside. In the museum world, the Yale Peabody Museum’s dioramas are considered masterpieces. In a true merge of arts and sciences, painters J. Perry Wilson and Francis Lee Jaques and preparator Ralph C. Morrill not only developed the lifelike foregrounds but also painstakingly created these habitat dioramas between 1944 and 1963. Current preparator Michael Anderson led the tour with stories and little-known secrets of the dioramas, as well as current techniques being employed to revive and restore these treasures.</p>
					<p>The second workshop was more technical, teaching the techniques of casting and molding for preparing various specimen on display. Each workshop participant learned to cast their finger(s) in dental silica before filling the cast with alginate to create a life-like replicas. Throughout the two workshops, we also learned about the history behind the creation of the dioramas and specimen in the Peabody and how new techniques are created each year to replace old specimen. The advent of 3D printing brings a whole new level of replication for the preparators hoping to create lightweight replicas of animal bodies to mount on the fur for taxidermy purposes. Even paper printing has proven to be a huge advance for the Peabody exhibits. Instead of creating maple leaves out of wax paper that crinkles over time, Michael Anderson has found another technique of color printing photos of maple leaves which then he encases in a plastic mold of the original leave – creating an exact replica in both shape and color for each leave photographed!</p>
					<br>
					<p class="bold">Looking Forward</p>
					<p>Due to the success of this year’s Beyond Boundaries Symposium, we hope to host annual symposiums celebrating the research and findings of Yale student and faculty who work at the intersection of various disciplines.</p>
					<p>For the summer, we are planning a series of design workshops for undergraduate researchers in New Haven, hopefully helping with the creation of posters and presentations for end of summer research symposiums.</p>
					<p>In the fall, we hope to collaborate with STEM and arts organizations on campus to host the first STEAM fair in celebrating the diversity of groups and interests on Yale campus. We plan to collaborate with the CEID and IPCH on more events as well as engage more of the incoming Yale community in recognizing the power of diversity of minds and academic backgrounds in all disciplines.</p>

				<p>As the debut event for the STEAM Pavilion, which was created in collaboration with Providence-local <a href="http://pneu.haus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pneuahus</a> and Brown STEAM over the past year, Brown STEAM led a workshop for the 2015 <a href="http://betterworldxdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Better World by Design</a> conference, titled “Meet Me in the Middle.” Better World by Design is a student-organized conference held annually at Brown + RISD that facilitates collaboration between designers, educators, and innovators. The theme this year was access.</p>

				</div>

				<p>Jonelle Ahiligwo ’16 and Kenji Endo ’18 led the workshop, which focused on the ways the physical structures and spaces we meet at can guide conversations we have within them. The workshop used the STEAM Pavilion to frame the conversation. The STEAM Pavilion is a 40ft by 40ft inflatable, tent-like, pentagon-shaped structure that can be entered through all five sides. The STEAM Pavilion was used as a starting point to examine the design and use of physical interdisciplinary, inclusive meeting spaces.These spaces aim to be accessible to people from different disciplines or backgrounds for exploration in a ‘middle,’ ‘neutral’ ground.</p>
				<div id="meet-me-collapse" class="collapse">
					<p>During the second half of the workshop, participants split into small groups to create some potential meeting spaces of their own. Half were given a hollow object (e.g. tubes, bottles, basket), and tasked to imagine what sort of function that form could take, going from Object/Space → Use. The other half were given a purpose (e.g. dancing, play, studio), and tasked to consider what potential forms could achieve that function, going from Use → Object/Space. From Form to Function, how can the form of an object lead to certain functions? For example, looking at an ice cream cone: the waffle cross-hatches can be used as aesthetic inspiration, the interior dome can be used as a communal space, the inverted ice cream cone can be used as structural support. In the other direction, Function to Form, what are some forms or needs that would satisfy the function you are given? For example, the function ‘play’ might require large spaces, room for a lot of tools, toys, and mobility. The participants were engaged and came up with various, creative solutions to their prompts, considering how a clear tube might be used as a vessel for ocean or space exploration, or what the aesthetic and spatial design of a meeting place for dancing might require.</p>

						<p class="caption-center">Participants brainstorm possible Form to Function designs.</p>
					</div>
					<p>After a share and tell of the participants’ innovative responses, we concluded the workshop with encouraging participants to challenge the existing uses of spaces and be more flexible with how we use physical structures every day. This is imperative to keep in mind as we move more and more into cross-disciplinary academia and work, and we need spaces to accommodate this innovation.</p>

				<p>In October 2015, Brown and RISD bioSTEAM went on a mushroom hunt guided by southern New England mushroom hunters Ryan Bouchard and Emily Schmidt. There were 13 participants from both Brown and RISD. The day started off with a presentation by Ryan and Emily in the RISD Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. We learned the basics about mushrooms, mushroom hunting and safety (“When in doubt, throw it out!”). Afterwards, we drove to nearby Lincoln Woods and foraged for mushrooms, finding quite a variety of different mushrooms in a relatively small area: including purple, red, white, brown, shelf-like, and clustered. Ryan and Emily had never seen one of the mushrooms before. After an hour of tromping through the underbrush, we sat down for a small picnic. Ryan and Emily cooked up some ‘chicken of the wood,’ an orange edible polypore mushroom from the Laetiporus family. Delicious!</p>
				<div id="mushroom-collapse" class="collapse">
					<p>During the hunt, we learned that not only are mushrooms and fungi vital parts of forest ecosystems, there are hundreds of species that contribute to the ecosystem. Each are unique and many are visually striking (though probably not edible).</p>

				<p>As I walked onto the Rutgers campus in New Brunswick during my spring break, many things were going through my mind: Did I park in the right place? Was I actually on the right campus? Was I too early? The main thing my mind kept coming back to as I entered a cafeteria was the question I came to answer in the first place: what is STEAM?</p>
				<p>This is something I am sure most who come in contact with our club ask themselves. I am sure it is also something members, project leaders, co-presidents, and presidents ask themselves as well. It is a daunting task to try and explain how we work and function as a sort of all-inclusive, event-organizing, ambiguous team of do-gooders banding together for a pursuit of everything interdisciplinary, interacting and intertwining with other interdisciplinary disciplines and back in on itself. You quickly find yourself in a loop as you sort of piece together, explain, and try to give examples.</p>
				<p>After finding myself in this loop time and time again, I was now being asked the same question once more. I was meeting with Danica Sapit, president of the newly formed Rutgers STEAM, to talk about how RISD got its start and good ways to keep the club flowing. As our conversation walked through topics like co-school communication and shared resources, we quickly came to the main task at hand—how do we use STEAM here at Rutgers? I paused for a moment while Anthony Peer, current head of RISD’s KinderSTEAM, began to talk about possibilities of touching an outer community and working with other schools and groups (all extremely important aspects of STEAM), but I felt like we were missing something greater than the all-inclusive approach. We needed to define STEAM as a more “meta” idea in order to think about how it could apply to any group.</p>
				<div id="adaptation-collapse" class="collapse">
					<p>The conclusion I came to is that there really is no definition to what STEAM is. In fact, it seems that trying to define STEAM is to limit the possibilities it can be defined as. Instead, I think that the best way to talk about STEAM is to not strictly talk about what it currently is by bringing up its beefy interdisciplinary background, but rather by showcasing its most important and probably most exciting ability: <span class="bold">adaptation</span>.</p>
					<p>At RISD for example, STEAM has formed sub-branches such as C+STEAM (focusing on technology and STEAM), bioSTEAM (focusing on biology and STEAM), Kinder STEAM (focusing on teaching STEAM) and so on. It can be said that these more focused groups exist due to their absence in the curriculum that RISD upholds. It can be said that C+STEAM has grown out of RISD's lack of coding curriculum and Brown's willingness to engage with designers. That being said, schools like MIT and Yale that already have these sort of curriculums in place may find it repetitive to try and keep the same subgroups as another school, limiting their abilities for STEAM to adapt.</p>
					<p>STEAM can and should mold to the needs of a school or collective. STEAM groups don’t strictly have to talk about biology or math, they can talk about material sciences in ceramics or watercolor technology. A group could form Glass STEAM or Sculpture STEAM or Design STEAM. The point is that STEAM takes the form of what is lacking in a community. It’s an opportunity to take charge of our own education, to pursue the intersections that are not addressed in the curriculums of the institutions we are attending, to collaborate with the community that we are surrounded by in order to nurture a more fruitful and academically inclusive space.</p>

				<p>Some of the earliest disciplinary boundaries were codified in the fifth century AD. There were four sciences, the <span class="italic">Quadrivium</span>, of overlapping music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, and the three humanities, the <span class="italic">Trivium</span>, with an ascending ladder of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. In the late 19th century, under the German model, universities secularized and the sciences proliferated and splintered. In the 20th, the social sciences codified, and today we are seeing the growth of cultural, queer, media, and post-colonial theory—alongside their establishment as disciplines in the universities.</p>
				<p>In the most basic sense, defining disciplines is an attempt at structure, a method of categorizing what might otherwise be ambiguous, interconnected clouds of human knowledge. The Trivium/Quadrivium had intent of pedagogy built-in, especially wherein grammar set the basis for logic, and logic the basis for rhetoric. These bodies of knowledge were expected to be learned in a specified order to build off each other effectively. Discipline is a structured categorization of ideas, processes, and viewpoints. David Staley writes:</p>
				<blockquote><p>Disciplines are types of ideas-spaces. An idea-space is “a domain or world viewed from the perspective of the intelligence embedded in it, intelligence that we can use… both to solve our everyday problems and to make the creative leaps that lead to breakthrough.” Academic disciplines are idea-spaces in that they “embed collective intelligence about the most effective way to carry out research, typically providing an overarching framework of established theory, principles, practices, heuristics, methodological assumptions, lab techniques, and so forth.”</p> <p class="citation">(from <a href="http://er.educause.edu/articles/2015/11/the-future-of-the-university-speculative-design-for-innovation-in-higher-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Future of the University</a>)</p></blockquote>
				<div id="lukas-collapse" class="collapse">
					<p>By drawing edges between what is outside and what is inside the discipline—extradisciplinary and interdisciplinary, respectively—a discipline inculcates an internal logic and common language. These are the greatest benefits of disciplinary lines: shared bases of understanding and similar language facilitate easier communication between researchers, across campuses or continents. Shared logic allows those in a field to follow the work of another. We have made enormous advances in knowledge by this facilitation of collaboration and sharing within disciplines.</p>
					<p>AWe know, though, that there is richness in the between. The STEAM movement is, in many ways, a reaction to the realization that groundbreaking ideas come from the boundaries of these idea-spaces, where they bump up against, or overlap with, other ones.</p>
					<blockquote><p>As Richard Ogle observed, “Creative leaps arise from the imaginative and insightful transfer of powerful, externally embedded intelligence from one idea-space to another.” He detailed the experiences of scientists, artists, and other creative people who developed new ideas or solved intractable problems because they could “leap from one-idea-space to another without getting trapped in a single one.”</p><p class="citation">(from <a href="http://er.educause.edu/articles/2015/11/the-future-of-the-university-speculative-design-for-innovation-in-higher-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Future of the University</a>)</p></blockquote>
					<p>Inside disciplines, practitioners can feel limited in practice. When disciplines rub together, however, we also find friction. C.P. Snow’s seminal 1959 lecture, titled “The Two Cultures” lamented the communication rift between scientific and literary intellectuals—clumping the whole spectrum of non-vocational disciplines into diverging camps. The potential richness at the middle ground between areas was being left unexplored, due to the difficulty in communicating across different approaches.</p>
					<p>In response, people caught to build a bridge, asking “what is a third culture?” How can we bring intellectual worlds together again, and celebrate the interstitial space? How can we prevent these diverging disciplinary camps from holding us back from intellectual growth?</p>
					<p>John Brockton began Edge, a publishing project, as a way to investigate <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/the-third-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Third Culture</a>. Some see <a href="http://chad.is/middle-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design as the Third culture</a> in how it blends material observation and human experience. STEAM, especially growing out of RISD, has often taken a design-driven approach to a new discipinaryism.</p>
					<p>Snow backpedaled after the “Two Cultures” lecture faced criticism. Edge was canonical in pushing for celebrating people working between disciplines, but it has yet to provide a rethinking of disciplines altogether.</p>
					<p>Counter-productive disciplinaryism isn’t just a rift between two intellectual poles, it is a more fine-grained splintering. It comes coupled with institutional accretion, outdated models of academic publishing, and bubbles of prestige around the institutions that declare disciplines as they are.</p>
					<p>The question thus remains, then—what comes after disciplines as we know them? What happens when we seek to move into classifications of knowledge that exist not in a Mode 1 or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mode 2</a> model, but a Mode 3—systems-based, contextual, temporal, and intertwined? Disciplines acknowledging of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Historicism</a>? We don’t need a bridge between two camps; we need a tapestry woven out of isolated threads.</p>
					<p>As we know well in STEAM, this is hard to do. Difficult Questions of the 21st century are not easily boxed in, we now know enough to realize they cannot honestly be. Design Researcher (and friend) <a href="http://nnnnicholas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicholas Shulman</a> said “Non-Disciplinarity is difficult because it requires creating a new context or constantly switching between existing ones.” It might even require creating contexts that do not yet exist.</p>
					<blockquote><p>In spite of what you majored in, or what the textbooks say, or what you think you’re an expert in, follow a system wherever it leads. It will be sure to lead across traditional disciplinary lines. To understand that system, you will have to be able to learn from–while not being limited by–economist and chemists and psychologists and theologians. You will have to penetrate their jargons, integrate what they tell you, recognize what they can honestly see through their particular lenses, and discard the distortions that come from the narrowness and incompleteness of their lenses. They won’t make it easy for you.</p><p class="citation">(Donella Meadows in “Thinking in Systems”)</p></blockquote>
					<p>There is anxiety in fighting disciplinaryism, this constant pushing against well-defined boundaries that permeate many corners of knowledge culture. New contexts are unexplored terrain. It’s even <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/articles/palcomms201521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psychologically documented</a>.</p>
					<blockquote><p>At the personal level, where interdisciplinary research is enmeshed with career progress, disciplinary anxieties and tensions at the interface between sometimes incommensurate kinds of thinking, there can be frictions and difficulties. These, however, are part of what makes such research so valuable, in that they enable individuals and groups within subjects on both sides to uncover those things that need to be better understood.</p></blockquote>
					<p>“Things that need to be better understood”—the intersections, connections, and in-between spaces of our current dictionary of disciplines. There are many words for these spaces.</p>
					<p>We talk about <span class="bold">multidisciplinaryism</span>—the coexistence of multiple disciplinary aspects on the same project—,<span class="bold">crossdisciplinaryism</span>—which seeks to understand one discipline from the viewpoint of another—, <span class="bold">interdisciplinaryism</span>—finding and working in the meeting points and similarities of disciplinary entities—and, hottest of all, <span class="bold">transdisciplinaryism</span>—which seeks to deeply intertwine these disciplinary entities and explore what norms might emerge beyond simplistic combinations of discipline.</p>
					<p>A famous institutional example of a “Mode 2” working style is the MIT Media Lab, broken down into working groups that are project-based rather than rooted in any disciplinary tradition. They are smaller in size than typical academic departments and are unafraid to borrow information and processes from wherever they find necessary in the intellectual landscape. The media lab calls itself a more nebulous term, <a href="http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2014/10/02/antidisciplinar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“antidisciplinary”</a>. Perhaps too we can appropriate thinking from David Batchelor’s 2000 Chromophobia, that “The interdisciplinary is often the antidisciplinary made safe.” Antidisciplinaryism has native to it a pushing-against, a reaction to the limitations of disciplinary boundary and mindsets. The Media Lab was founded in the 1980s and Antidiscplinaryism’s punk outlook reflects that.</p>
					<p>Antidisciplinarity starts from the posit that disciplinaryism can be escaped at all. I am interested instead in something I believe STEAM has been indicative of—a criticality of disciplines, but recognizing the benefits they carry, too: shared language/logic, cohesive knowledge base, and community. Acknowledging that the categorization of knowledge is difficult to escape, near-impossible in academic settings. That the context of history, place, and peoples within disciplines cannot be ignored. Something that makes use of increasingly networked modes of knowledge sharing and knowledge sharing. Antidiscplinaryism in the age of Historicism.</p>
					<p>In a conversation with my friend, category and cultural theorist <a href="http://fds.duke.edu/db/aas/math/grad/dv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dmitry Vagner</a>, we recognized that simplistic metaphors of disciplinary boundaries are not high-dimensional enough to effectively explain the topology of the new knowledge landscape. Not only do we have idea-spaces, but we have, in and around a discipline, layers of evolution, colonialism, false starts, and blurred edges. Disciplines are no longer regions to be drawn in the 2D plane: they are fully-dimensioned objects. Our next steps in breaking them down come through meaningful interweaving. In the tradition of Intersectionality with regards to intermeshed systems of identity and oppression, we seek a term that acknowledges that new knowledge can no longer internally justify itself and its separation from other modes of thought.</p>
					<p>In this vein, I seek to propose the use of the term hyphdisciplinary. (Alternatives include “disciplinary queer” and “disciplinary-fluid”.) “Hyph-,“ a prefix meaning “web,” makes literal the metaphor of a multi-dimensional inescapability of intertwined systems of knowledge.</p>
					<p>Slow-moving as they may be, our universities are increasingly cognizant of the Historicism-minded fields. It is time the language we use to explain the topology of disciplinaryism catches up. With further inclusion of modes of thought from the Humanities, Cultural Studies, and Media Theory, STEAM will continue to charge towards our hyphdisciplinary future.</p>
