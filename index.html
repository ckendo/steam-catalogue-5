                <p>We are RISD, Brown, MIT, and Yale STEAM. <a href="http://steamwith.us" style="text-decoration:underline;">STEAM</a> is STEM + Art/Design.</p>
                <p class="fourtwenty">We strive to integrate the creativity and aesthetics of the arts; the problem solving tools and rigor of the STEM fields; &amp; the critical thinking and ethical considerations of the humanities. We believe that this unification powerfully drives progress toward the future. This is our fourth Catalogue.</p>
                <p>This fourth catalogue contains everything we've done from Winter 2015 to Spring 2015.</p>
                <p class="fourtwenty subheaderbold"><span class="hide_mobile">Optimized for the latest versions of Chrome/Safari.

                <br/>
                <p>This Catalogue, like the catalogue of a show, is a collection of documented work. At STEAM, this includes workshops, lectures, installations, discussions, and writing we created this spring.</p>
                <p>STEAM Press, the mechanism through which Catalogue is published, accepts submissions from members of our communities, and outside contributors. Please reach out to us if you would like to add to the next issue of Catalogue.</p>
                <p>The theme of this Catalogue is "Patterns for Play".

                <p>The SMPTE (The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) color bars shown above is a television test pattern, along with a continuous  audio tone, which acts as a known standard for all other broadcasting programs to adjust their equipment to. This test pattern is used only where the NTSC analog video standard is utilized, such as countries in North America where we, as one of the last generations of TV watching children, might still recognize it in the wisps of our nostalgic memory.</p>

                <p class="fourfifteen">Video and audio engineers can compare this known standard to the received pattern from other TV stations or broadcasters so that the program material is showing the analog video chrominance <span class="show_mobile">and luminance information correctly. Therefore, a TV station or or network broadcaster usually will transmit this test pattern with the audio tone together before sending program material in order to show legitimacy and authority of the transmission line, so that the receiving stations may adjust their equipment accordingly.</span></p>

                <p>Each semester, the STEAM clubs collect documentation and materials from our open call for interdisciplinary work for our catalogues. Such as the SMPTE is a known standard for analog video transmission, this Catalogue strives to be a known source of documentation and support for the rising STEAM movement. This Catalogue is an open broadcast to the STEAM community: students, educators, politicians, administrators, industry leaders, health care professionals, activists, artists, and designers. This is our pattern for play, for learning, for improving, and for growing. We hope that you will contribute to the standard that we are trying to build, in part, with the projects and communities described in the following chapters. We hope that you will receive our signal and in return, respond with your own patterns for play.</p>

                <p>The Winter-session and IAP (Independent Activities Period) workshop series is an annual 4-week event organized by the collective STEAM clubs. Workshop sessions are held once every week during the intermission between Fall and Spring semester (January – February) – and culminates in a gallery exhibition showcasing the projects developed.</p> 
                <p>The schema for this year’s workshop series was to capitalize on the diversity of specializations and academic degree of the participants – to maximize the potential for collaborative dynamics and minimize any programmatic redundancies. It was imperative to design content that could engage an illustrator, a mechanical engineer, and a medical practitioner at the same time.</p>

                <p class="subheaderbold">Ending Notes:</p>
                <p>Unfortunately due to the scale of the workshop series, STEAM can only invite a maximum of fifteen students. However, we are committed to extending facets of the event to anyone that is so inclined to participate. As such, through Body+Internet, we invited NASA’s Propulsion Laboratory’s Visual Strategist: <a href="http://www.directedplay.com/" style="text-decoration:underline;">Dan Goods</a> to share with us his narrative. The talk, open to the public, <span class="show_mobile">provided an inspiring discussion on the operations of his team within a STEM-centric environment. And how he has managed a symbiotic relationship with the scientists at NASA. The event received a successful reception and caused great excitement in the community at large!</span></p>
